# Which Head Unit is this?
This is sold by many Chinese vendors under various brand names. If it is mentioned as Android 10 T3 processor, then chances are its this one. To find out, go to the Car settings and check the version number. It should have K2001 somewhere in it. 

# What is my android Version?
In most cases the device is not actually Android 10. It is just a trick by the vendors. If you go the Car Settings and look at the device details, it would be mentioned as K2001N_*** or K2001M_*** etc. The letter after the K2001 indicates the real android version (N = Nougat = Android 7, etc)
